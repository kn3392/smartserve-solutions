expects from the proposed system without going into technical implementation details.


2. Business Background

• To automate service request handling
• To improve service tracking and transparency
• To reduce manual workload

• To improve overall customer satisfaction


4. Existing System Problems

The current system suffers from multiple issues such as lack of centralized data, slow
communication, difficulty in tracking service progress, and absence of online payment
options. These problems negatively affect both customers and management.


5. Proposed Business Solution

SmartServe Solutions proposes a centralized web-based system that allows customers to
request services online, track progress, and make payments. The system will also help
administrators manage operations efficiently.

The new system will result in faster service delivery, better customer engagement, reduced
operational costs, improved data accuracy, and enhanced brand reputation.
